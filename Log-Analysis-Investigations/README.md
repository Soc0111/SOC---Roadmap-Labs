# Cyber Incident Investigation Lab

## Project Overview
Welcome to my Log Analysis Lab. This repository serves as a portfolio of my technical investigations into various cyber threats. Here, I analyze raw system logs to detect malicious activity, perform digital forensics, and document incident response steps.

## Tech Stack & Skills
* **Operating Systems:** Linux (Kali, Ubuntu), Windows Server.
* **Analysis Techniques:** Log Parsing, Correlation, Threat Hunting.
* **Frameworks:** NIST Incident Response Lifecycle, MITRE ATT&CK®.
* **Tools:** Bash, Python, Grep/Awk, SIEM Logic.

## Investigation Index
